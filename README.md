1.CHARACTERISTICS OF BIG DATA
VOLUME:
It the size of the data which is collected which is huge and unimaginable.
VELOCITY:
the speed at which data is generated and accumulated in the database.
VARIETY:
the data stored will be in various form like image,PDF etc.which will not be alike the 
management of those irrelevant data refers to variety.
VERACITY:
Big Data Veracity refers to the biases, noise and abnormality in data. Is the data that is being stored
veracity in data analysis is the biggest challenge. 
VALUE: 
 We uncover the meaningful relationships and patterns from the raw datas we collect from not only logs/text but also media
 and cctv footages
 2.SCALING UP AND SCALING OUT:
 SCALE UP :   
- it consumes more money and time as well the reliabilty will be low.   
- Scaling up is taking what you’ve got, and replacing it with something more powerful.  
From a networking perspective, this could be taking a 1GbE switch, and replacing it   
with a 10GbE switch. Same number of switchports, but the bandwidth has been scaled    
up via bigger pipes. The 1GbE bottleneck has been relieved by the 10GbE replacement.     
SCALE OUT :    
- rather than scale up this will be contrast where co ordianation is better since 
machines were shared with work as well machine failure will be handled.    
- Scaling out takes the infrastructure you’ve got, and replicates it to work in parallel.  
This has the effect of increasing infrastructure capacity roughly linearly. 
Data centers often scale out using pods. Build a compute pod, spin up applications to use it, then scale  
out by building another pod to add capacity. Actual application performance may not be linear,  
as application architectures must be written to work effectively in a scale-out environment.
